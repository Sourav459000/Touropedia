is the author of ‘Dnyaneshwari’, a commentary on the holy Bhagavad Gita. He believed that the chanting of the name of 
the Lord is the best way to reach Him. Sant Dnyaneshwar had performed the miracle of making a buffalo recite the 
Vedas. Dnyaneshwar remains one of India’s most beloved saints and his Samadhi Shrine in Alandi (in which he was 
voluntarily entombed in Nirvikalpa Samadhi while alive) is visited by thousands of people every year. He is widely 
revered as an incarnation of Krishna. Centuries later, Sant Eknath entered the tomb and saw a radiant youth seated in 
meditation. Dnyaneshwar is still believed to be alive, anchoring his light body as a crystal of enlightened energy 
radiating from Alandi to the entire world. ''',
